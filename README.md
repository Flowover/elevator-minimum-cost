# elevator-minimum-cost
At the begining we have nrid people that  will use the elevator. We give it as an input. 
Then we give as an input  each  person's destination  and the  number of   elevator's stations. 
 The cost of the people  is equals to  zero.
People who want to go to any other and not the current  floor should  go on foot.
The cost of every floor is one.
At the end the program will calculate the minimum cost and the floors that elevator stops.
I've  implementate this algorithm in 3 ways. Dynamic Programing (DP), Recursively, and Recursively with memoization.
