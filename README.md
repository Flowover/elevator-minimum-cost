# elevator-minimum-cost
At the begining we have nrid people that  will use the elevator. We give it as an input. 
Then we give as an input the destinations of the person's and the  number of   elevator stations. 
The people who want to go at the floor that elevator stops costs zero.
The people who want to go to any floor except the floor that elevator stops must go on foot.
Every floor a person passes costs 1.
At the end the program will calculate the minimum cost and the floors that elevator stops.
I've  implementate this algorithm in 3 ways. Dynamic Programing (DP), Recursively, and Recursively with memoization.
