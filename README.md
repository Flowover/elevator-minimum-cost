# elevator-minimum-cost

This is an elevator optimization problem. We will have a small number of people( **nrid** people) using the elevator at first. We give it as an input. Then we give as input eachÂ person's destination and the number of elevator stations. At the start, the total transmission cost of the people is zero. People who want to go anywhere other than the current floor should go on foot. Each floor has a transmission cost equal to one if the customer wants to go on a floor on foot. In the end, the program will calculate the overall minimum transmission cost required for people to reach their destination floor and the floors that the elevator stops. I've implemented this algorithm in three ways. Dynamic Programming (DP), Recursively, and Recursively with Memoization
