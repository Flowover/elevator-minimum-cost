# elevator-minimum-cost
This is an elevator  optimization problem.
At the begining we have **nrid** people that  will use the elevator. We give it as an input. 
Then we give as an input  each  **person's destination  and the  number of   elevator's stations**. 
The overall transmission cost of the people is equals to zero at the beginning.
People who want to go to any other and not in the current floor should  go on foot.
Each floor has a transmission cost equal to one if the customer wants to go on a floor on foot.
In the end the program will calculate the overall minimum transmission cost required for people 
to reach their destination floor and the floors that elevator stops.
I've  implementate this algorithm in 3 ways. Dynamic Programing (DP), Recursively, and Recursively with memoization.
